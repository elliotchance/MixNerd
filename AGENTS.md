# Tests

- Unit tests should only have a `@Test` annotation and should not have a
  separate text description.
- Test files should include a struct that is the same name as the file,
  ie. `TrackTimeEstimator`.
- Each test function should be named as `test<function>` is there is only
  one case, or `test<function>_<description>` for different cases.
