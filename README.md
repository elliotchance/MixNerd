MixNerd is perfect for tagging and organizing your downloaded mp3 files. It can:

1. **Save MP3 tags** including artist, title, date and cover art from 1001tracklists.com.
2. **Move and rename files** on save.
3. **Generate `.cue` files**, even when some track times are missing.

Just **Open...** a folder contains mp3 files and bring up the tracklist page, the changed metadata will be shown in yellow:

Now press **Save** and the mix is tagged and moved. It's that easy!

This is configurable, but I choose to organize as `{source}/{year}/{date} {title}/{date} {title}`:

The `.cue` file works with many players - including the awesome - [VOX](https://vox.rocks/mac-music-player):
